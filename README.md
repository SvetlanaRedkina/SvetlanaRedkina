- Hi, I’m Svetlana :wave:
- Glad to see you here! :blush:

⭐ I could never believe that I would find myself in Data Analytics. ⭐

 For years I’d thought of myself as someone who would do well in Economics; it was my favorite college subject. Studying Economics made me wonder what could affect business decisions and how companies could make better choices. It was critical to me to build a career in a field where I could not only leverage my theoretical but also practical skills. There were other questions I wanted to ask myself, ‘What career path could challenge me? What profession specializes in noticing patterns and ensures details are not overlooked? What field has room for mastering expertise?’ I turned to Data Analytics and at last found my calling. 🤩
 
  Analytics is mind-blowing and multifaceted. It has so much to offer; it incorporates focus on a problem, strategic thinking, and storytelling of the big picture. Data-driven decisions are like artwork to me; analysts use thousands of spreadsheets and lines of code as their sketches. Similar to an artist who polishes their technique for hours, an analyst keeps scrolling through a block of SQL queries that should work but doesn’t. This is how I got hooked on the feeling of anticipation. I also believe I crave the sense of achievement that fills me when my code works. My favorite so far is crawling through web pages in Scrapy; that is where I allow a curious part of me to bloom.🌺

I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge of programming languages and frameworks. 

My specialties so far include:

  SQL🗒: Keys, Functions, Derived Tables, Regular Expressions, Joins and Union All, Views, Case, Stored Procedures, User-defined Variables, ACID transactions
  
  Python🐍: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow
  
  Data Engineering: Scrapy, Splash, Selenium

  Machine Learning🔧: 
  Supervised Learning

  Statistics and Probability📈: Summary Statistics, Correlation, Regression Analysis, Conditional Probability

  Data Visualization📊: Tableau, MS Power BI, MS Excel

  Version Control (Git), Command Line
